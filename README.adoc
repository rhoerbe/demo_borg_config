= Application configuration using BORG and Django-style config module loading

== BORG
As Alex Martelli explains nicely in his http://www.aleax.it/5ep.html[Five Easy Pieces: Simple Python Non-Patterns],
a Singleton pattern is neither ideal nor semantically really appropriate for sharing state.

== Django-style config file loading

Django allows users to specify the settings module in an environment variable.

This concept is extended by providing a default configuration.

== Description

This demo project shows how to employ a global configuration object in an application,
fulfilling following requirements:

1. Configration data can be loaded with a plain function call, and does not need to be passed around.
2. The configuration can be loaded from a file specified in an environment variable.
3. Configration data already loaded can be overwritten.
   This enabled a program to obtain CLI args to change the configured defaults.
